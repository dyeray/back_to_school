# Important Files

* algorithms.py: Contains the algorithms required to answer the challenge questions.
* graph.py: Simple implementation of directed graph.
* main.py: Solves the questions of the challenge by using the implemented classes.


# Run

To answer the provided questions, run:

python main.py

You can provide an alternative graph to main.py if you want to answer the same questions over a different configuration. For this, you can run:

python main.py --graph=\<path_to_graph.json\>


# Test

To run the tests, run:

python -m unittest


Note: This code has been tested on Python 3.5.2 for Windows, although it should work on other systems.
